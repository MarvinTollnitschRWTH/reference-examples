Transient stability analysis of IEEE 9 bus system

## Description

This is part of my grad project where I simulated dynamic model of IEEE 9 bus system.
This is only the initial stage of simulation studies where I need to do analyze transient stability of system for a fault at line5-7 with clearing time 1.083 s.
Rest of the studies were continued in PSSE to take advantage of dynamic wind turbine models in it.
