_Version 1.0.0.0 (38.8 KB) by A.Delavari_

SimPowerSystems model of the IEEE 9-bus system, known as the Western System Coordinated Council

## Description

WSCC system is widely used for transient stability study.
The synchronous machines are equipped with voltage regulators combined with an exciter and comprehensive model of steam turbine and governors.

The foundation case data are presented in: J. Chow, G. Rogers, and K. Cheung, “Power system toolbox,” Cherry
Tree Scientific Software, vol. 48, p. 53, 2000.

If you are using this benchmark in your research or teaching, please include explicit mention of the reference paper.
